Read in the data
```{r}
pitch_df = read_csv("./data/HW7-politeness_data.csv")
```

Provide boxplots to show the relation between gender/attitude and pitch (ignoring di􏰀erent scenarios)
```{r}
pitch_df %>% 
  group_by(gender, attitude) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = frequency, color = attitude)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Fromt the above boxplots, it appears that females tend to have a higher frequency than males. In addition, those with informal attitude may have a slightly higher pitch than those with polite attitude.
